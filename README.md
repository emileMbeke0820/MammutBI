> ### difference betwenn https and ssh

 
> ### HTTPS
> It uses password authentication for pushing. 
> You will be asking to enter your GitHub passowrd every time you push. It's possible for Git to remember your password for a few minute.
> It is been said that HTTPS is less secure than SSH because you have to store your GitHub Account permanently, which is very risky and 
> can be hacked. 
> To avoid using your password everytime you push, you have to enebale two-factor authentication and use personal access token.

> ### personal access token
> Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line.
> 1. The first step is to verify your email if not verified yet.
> 2. Click your profile photo then Settings
> 3. In the left sidebar, click  Developer settings then click Personal access tokens.
> 4. Click Generate new token and give it a name of your choice.
> 5. Select the Expiration drop-down menu, then click a default or use the calendar picker to give your token an expiration. 
> PS: As a security precaution, GitHub automatically removes personal access tokens that haven't been used in a year. 
> 6. To use your token to access repositories from the command line, select repo. You can also select the scopes, or permissions, you'd like to grant >    this token.
> 7. Click Generate token , GitHub will confirm it. That's all. 
> According to GitHub-documentation, HTTPS is in some cases a little faster than SSH, especially over high-latency connections.
> Git Credential Manager (GCM) is another way to store your credentials securely and connect to GitHub over HTTPS. With GCM, you don't have to 
> manually create and store a PAT, as GCM manages authentication on your behalf, including 2FA (two-factor authentication).




> ### SSH
> To use public-key authentication, You have to generate a keypair (or "public key"), then add it to your GitHub account.
> Using keys is more secure than passwords, since you can add many to the same account 
>(for example, a key for every computer you use GitHub from). The private keys on your computer can be protected with passphrases
> GitHub does not require two-factor auth since we don't use a password for ssh.
> With the public-key, you can push and pull but not edit your GitHub, which is good in case you lose your private key. All you have to do is 
> to remove is from your Account. 
> You can follow 
> [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
> to generate a ssk-key.
