# > difference betwenn https and ssh
 

> Https and SSH are two protocols used to identify yourself. There is not such a big diference between them. The main difference is that
>
>  https is less complicated and faster than ssh. But everytime you use it, you'll be asking to enter your username and passowrd, which .
>
> isn't always fun. SSH on the other hand is hard to configure but more secure and once you generate your ssh key pair and add it to your 
>
> GitHub account, GitHub will reconize it everytime you connect. If however you want to keep it with https without entering your username  
>
> and password each time, you should create a Credential Helper Manage with the command :  git config --global credential.helper cache . 
>
> Git will generate a personnal access token for you and there will be no need to enter your 

> username and passowrd again.
