### SQL Data Definition Language (DDL)
  Data definition allows the user to define new tables and elements.
 
> ### CREATE - with the CREATE statement you can create a new table in an existing database.
>
> ### DROP - with the DROP statement in SQL you can delete tables, which you no longer need
>
> ### TRUNCATE - with the TRUNCATE statement, you can delete all the content in the table, but keep the actual table intact and ready for further use
>

### SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  Data manipulation is essential for SQL tables - it allows you to modify an already created table with new information, update the already existing values or delete them. 
>
> ### SQL INSERT
>   With the INSERT statement, you can add new rows to an already existing table. New rows can contain information from the start, or can be with a 
>   NULL value.
>
> ### SQL UPDATE
>   With the UPDATE statement, you can easily modify the already existing information in an SQL table.
> 
> ### SQL DELETE
>   With the DELETE statement you can remove unneeded rows from a table.
>

### SQL Data Control Language (DCL)
  SQL allows the user to define the access each of the table users can have to the actual table.
>  
> ### GRANT 
> with the GRANT statement, you can authorize users to modify the selected table.
> 
> ### REVOKE 
> with the REVOKE statement you can remove all privileges, previously granted to a user.
